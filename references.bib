abstract = {This paper reports an attempt to apply the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) in rural China. The CVM was used to obtain estimates of willingness to pay for restoring Ejina ecosystem services. In our survey, we used a payment card format and a 12-page survey booklet with maps depicting the reasons why Ejina ecosystem deteriorated, the means by which ecosystem services could be restored from their current level. We used an in-person interview along with the survey booklet. We employed a parametric model to estimate the benefits of restoring Ejina ecosystem. Results from 700 in-person interviews indicate that households would pay an average of 19.37 (RMB) per year with 20.78 per household for the main river area, and 16.41 per household for the rest of Hei basin. The aggregate benefit to residents of the Hei basin is 8.84 million annually for 20 years. Taking into account an environmental discount rate calculated by using respondent's equivalent utility between periodical payments and lump sum payments, the present value of aggregate benefit of restoring Ejina ecosystem is 55.33 million. These results suggest that the general public in Hei Valley would be willing to pay to restore the Ejina ecosystem, although this amount is substantially less than the estimated costs of restoration. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Water crises are spreading across the length of South Asia at an
alarming rate, and some of the pockets of stress include unexpected
locations such as Darjeeling, West Bengal, where rainfall is plentiful.
This article explores the problems of post-colonial water management in
the former British hill station to illuminate the prospects for
integrated resource provision. We argue that to improve the scope of
water distribution and provision, post-colonial townships such as
Darjeeling need to acknowledge and address the multiple ways in which
people get water from the centralised supply as well as the
decentralised solutions that have arisen through community organisation
in collectives known as samaj. Notably, the samaj have a distinct
character based on histories of colonial neglect that prompted villages
throughout the Darjeeling region to solve socioeconomic problems
independently of centralised systems. The discussion overlaps the
numerous resource pathways with the plethora of social and political
organisations operating in Darjeeling to argue that municipalities would
do well to harness the varied ways in which water flows through the
township. Integrated within larger questions of sustainable development
in India's urbanising townships, the text offers a glimpse into the
possibilities for more holistic and equitable water management.},

abstract = {The economic value of restoring Deckers Creek in Monongalia and Preston counties of West Virginia was determined from mail, Internet, and personal contact surveys. Multiattribute, choice experiments were conducted and nested logit models were estimated to derive the economic values of full restoration for three attributes of this creek: aquatic life, swimming, and scenic quality. Their relative economic values were that aquatic life > scenic quality ≈ swimming. These economic values imply that respondents had the highest value for aquatic life when fully restoring Deckers Creek to a sustainable fishery rather than a “put and take” fishery that cannot sustain fish populations. The welfare improvement estimates for full restoration of all three attributes ranged between $12 and $16 per month per household. Potential stream users (anglers) had the largest welfare gain from restoration, while nonangler respondents had the lowest. When these estimates were aggregated up to the entire watershed population, the benefit from restoration of Deckers Creek was estimated to be about $1.9 million annually. This benefit does not account for any economic values from partial stream restoration. On the basis of log likelihood tests of the nested logit models, two subsamples of the survey population (the general population and stream users) were found to be from the same population. Thus restoration choices by stream users may be representative of the watershed population, although the sample size of stream users was small in this research. },

Cheap talk and certainty scales have received considerable attention in the literature, but dissonance minimization has not previously been experimentally tested. Using a four-way split sample design involving over 600 subjects, results from an actual referendum on provision of a quasi-public good were compared with three similar but contingent referenda employing the three bias-reducing techniques. Hypothetical bias was again present. Certainty scales, when properly calibrated, and dissonance minimization were found to be most effective in reducing the bias.},

Today it is now assumed by many environmental and resource economists and policy analysts working in developing countries that contingent valuation surveys are straightforward and easy to do. This paper examines some of the issues that have arisen and some of the lessons learned over the last 10 years about administering contingent valuation surveys in developing countries. The paper focuses on five issues in particular. 1.(a) explaining to enumerators what a contingent valuation study is all about;2.(b) interpreting responses to contingent valuation questions;3.(c) setting referendum prices;4.(d) constructing joint public-private CV scenarios;5.(e) ethical problems in conducting such surveys.\n It is argued that there are numerous issues that arise in contingent valuation work in developing countries that demand careful attention, but that in many respects it is easier to do high-quality contingent valuation surveys in developing countries than in industrialized countries.},

abstract = {Convergent validity tests of benefit transfer accuracy show errors to range from a few percentage points to 100% and more. This paper discusses three potential sources of errors that affect the accuracy of benefit transfers. (1) The measurement of values is subject to random errors and the caprices that arise from the many judgments and technical assumptions required by the researchers who conduct the primary studies. Measurement error occurs when researchers' decisions affect the transferability of measures of value or as the result of sampling. (2) Generalization error occurs when a measure of value is generalized to unstudied sites or resources. Generalization error is inversely related to the correspondence between study sites and policy sites. (3) Publication selection bias occurs when the objectives for publishing research limit benefit transfer applications of research outcomes. Criteria for selecting which research results are published may be at odds with the needs of benefit transfer practitioners. Several means for overcoming these sources of error are offered: standardized application of tested methods; closer adherence to benefit transfer protocol; the establishment of an e-journal with explicit criteria for fully recording, reporting, and disseminating research, which has the primary objective of estimating empirical measures of value. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Early chapters provide accessible introductory materials suitable for non-economists. These chapters also detail how benefit transfer is used within the policy process. Later chapters cover more advanced topics suited to valuation researchers, graduate students and those with similar knowledge of economic and statistical theory and methods. This book provides the most complete coverage of environmental benefit transfer methods available in a single location. The book targets a wide audience, including undergraduate and graduate students, practitioners in economics and other disciplines looking for a one-stop handbook covering benefit transfer topics and those who wish to apply or evaluate benefit transfer methods. It is designed for those both with and without training in economics},

@article{Bennear2013a,
abstract = {We conducted a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh to examine how household drinking-water choices were affected by two different messages about risk from naturally occurring groundwater arsenic. Households in both randomized treatment arms were informed about the arsenic level in their well and whether that level was above or below the Bangladesh standard for arsenic. Households in one group of villages were encouraged to seek water from wells below the national standard. Households in the second group of villages received additional information explaining that lower-arsenic well water is always safer and these households were encouraged to seek water from wells with lower levels of arsenic, irrespective of the national standard. A simple model of household drinking-water choice indicates that the effect of the emphasis message is theoretically ambiguous. Empirically, we find that the richer message had a negative, but insignificant, effect on well-switching rates, but the estimates are sufficiently precise that we can rule out large positive effects. The main policy implication of this finding is that a one-time oral message conveying richer information on arsenic risks, while inexpensive and easily scalable, is unlikely to be successful in reducing exposure relative to the status-quo policy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The goals of the river restoration in terms of ecosystem services are identified, as are the valuation methods used. More than two-thirds of the 38 river restorations reviewed sought to restore and protect fish populations, including in many cases threatened or endangered species. River restorations were also frequently undertaken to improve wildlife habitat, and water quality for boating. In terms of the use of non-market valuations in decision making, six of 38 restorations reviewed involved benefit-cost analyses or environmental assessments or equivalent decision documents. While both revealed preference and stated preference methods were used for valuing river restorations, the majority of restoration valuations (27 out of 38, about 70%) utilized stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). Annual willingness-to-pay per household estimated from the stated preference methods appear logically and positively related to the miles of river restored demonstrating weak scope.},

The WTP estimated using the delta method was about INR 494.00 (USD 1 ∼ INR 60.00 as of March 2014) per month, which is about 12 times the amount they currently pay. A major policy implication is that there is a huge potential for investment in water projects in the town because of the high WTP and the households' preference for local water body or any organised service provider over the private water vendors.},

Although health risk perceptions associated with drinking water are ranked low in comparison with other risks, they are subject to influence from the media as a primary information source. Although there may not be a strong connection between odour detection and health risk, consumers who make such a connection cannot be dismissed as irrational. There are substantial grounds to support the possibility that unfamiliar drinking water odours might reveal the presence of substances which pose a potential health risk. Failure to provide credible evidence as to the actual causes of odours will leave water utilities in an indefensible position on associated health risk.},

@book{Islam2016,
abstract = {Preface: Life without water cannot survive so water is called as the symbol of life. Access to freshwater is a basic human right. Water problems in Bangladesh arise both during the dry season and in the rainy season. Flash floods occur in summer and in the rainy season by sudden release of water at the upstream or by heavy downpour. Again, in the dry season, small rivers dry up because of shortage of water in the big rivers owing to withdrawal of water at the upstream through barrages built and operated by neighbouring country. As a result, irrigation projects in Bangladesh based on river water cease to function, causing losses in crop production and increase in poverty. to follow or abide by ethical principles. This negligence has lingered many of the problems related to sharing international freshwater bodies. This book stands between two concepts of human life, which are interrelated with each other. I envision that this book by virtue of its interdisciplinary character may prove useful in several different kinds of courses: (a) For courses in Social Work that now go under the title of Social Problem Analysis. This book provides a base for studying the economic characteristics of poverty other than the social ones. (b) For course in Methods of Social Research. This book is an introduction of applying modern methods and techniques of scientific and advanced social research. In modern social research, a researcher is concerned with different traditions of knowledge, attitudes, environments and problems. A social worker deals with men and his surroundings. My hope is that it may be a modest contribution to both socio-economic-environmental problem analysis and advanced research methods. Construction of theoretical policy model and use of computer software for simulation purposes must focus new ideas in social work research, which may expand our knowledge in this regard, and I hope students of social sciences in Bangladesh and readers of this book may test some new ideas of using modern social research technologies. It was a challenge for me to publish this research as a book and I carried on helpful conversation with my wife Dr. Wardatul Akmam and former laboratory mate Dr. Mizunoya Takeshi, Dr. Kobayashi Shintarou face-to-face and by e-mail. By this I tried to mitigate the new alerted problems and ideas. However, I am solely responsible for any errors in fact or interpretation which may exist in this book. In a work of this kind, there always remains scope for improvement. Any suggestions of readers are invited and would be accepted gratefully. Although this book is based on a particular research work, I hope it would be helpful for the students and researchers interested in socio-economic and environmental related issues.

Tap water was consumed regularly by only 50.8 percent of the consumers and bottled water by 42.7 %. Consumer dissatisfaction regarding the quality of tap water was noted. Fourteen percent were dissatisfied with the odor, and 30.6 % with the taste or flavor. Health risks, regarding ingestion of tap water, were mainly not perceived or seen only as a minor issue to consumers. Multiple regression analysis indicated that knowledge of the source of the water was not a major determinant for selecting alternatives to tap water (e.g., bottled water or use of home treatment devices). Such use of alternatives was in fact six times higher in consumers dissatisfied with the taste of the water (OR = 6.0, p = 0.001) and only 35 % higher if people were connected to a distribution network using the St. Lawrence River as the source of supply (OR = 1.35, p= 0.01).

@article{Ahlers2015,
abstract = {The culturally and ecologically diverse region of the Eastern Himalayas is the target of ambitious hydropower development plans. Policy discourses at national and international levels position this development as synergistically positive: it combines the production of clean energy to fuel economic growth at regional and national levels with initiatives to lift poor mountain communities out of poverty. Different from hydropower development in the 20th century in which development agencies and banks were important players, contemporary initiatives importantly rely on the involvement of private actors, with a prominent role of the private finance sector. This implies that hydropower development is not only financially viable but also understood as highly profitable. This paper examines the new development of hydropower in the Eastern Himalaya of Nepal and India. It questions its framing as green energy, interrogates its links with climate change, and examines its potential for investment and capital accumulation. To do this, we also review the evidence on the extent to which its construction and operation may modify existing hydrogeological processes and ecosystems, as well as its impacts on the livelihoods of diverse groups of people that depend on these. The paper concludes that hydropower development in the region is characterised by inherent contentions and uncertainties, refuting the idea that dams constitute development projects whose impacts can be simply predicted, controlled and mitigated. Indeed, in a highly complex geological, ecological, cultural and political context that is widely regarded to be especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, hydropower as a development strategy makes for a toxic cocktail.},

A sample of 210 women drawn using systematic random procedure is used for the study. Formal interview is the main instrument used. The survey has established that income, quality of water, hours spent fetching water during scarcity and age are the main factors influencing women's health in the metropolis during water scarcity. In both the core and periphery, the water-related problem influencing health is hours spent fetching water during scarcity. An empirical model on water needs and women's health has emerged from the survey. Recommendations have been made on strategies to ensure regular volume of surface water, effective management of scarce water resources with the participation of women, and ensuring gender equity in domestic services.},

Using a unique dataset of 524 households from an urban hill town of Darjeeling in India, this study addresses two key issues of (a) determining the drivers of risk perception from water use, and (b) understanding whether water treatment decisions and choice of water sources are jointly made by the households. The results from probit model show that the age of the head, perception of the aesthetic qualities of water (odour and colour), education level of the head, the volume of improved water used, water treatment decision and expenditure on the water are the significant drivers of risk perception. The results of a rare investigation on the likelihood of the joint decision of treating water and choice of water source show that these decisions are indeed jointly made in the study area. Households decision to treat water from an unimproved source and the choice of improved water can be seen as substitutes.},

Cheap talk, follow-up certainty scales, and dissonance minimization are three techniques for reducing this hypothetical bias. Cheap talk and certainty scales have received considerable attention in the literature, but dissonance minimization has not previously been experimentally tested. Using a four-way split sample design involving over 600 subjects, results from an actual referendum on provision of a quasi-public good were compared with three similar but contingent referenda employing the three bias-reducing techniques.

abstract = {We conducted a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh to examine how household drinking-water choices were affected by two different messages about risk from naturally occurring groundwater arsenic. Households in both randomized treatment arms were informed about the arsenic level in their well and whether that level was above or below the Bangladesh standard for arsenic. Households in one group of villages were encouraged to seek water from wells below the national standard. Households in the second group of villages received additional information explaining that lower-arsenic well water is always safer and these households were encouraged to seek water from wells with lower levels of arsenic, irrespective of the national standard. A simple model of household drinking-water choice indicates that the effect of the emphasis message is theoretically ambiguous. Empirically, we find that the richer message had a negative, but insignificant, effect on well-switching rates, but the estimates are sufficiently precise that we can rule out large positive effects. The main policy implication of this finding is that a one-time oral message conveying richer information on arsenic risks, while inexpensive and easily scalable, is unlikely to be successful in reducing exposure relative to the status-quo policy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper discusses some of the main variables involved in public perception of drinking water quality. Research on this topic suggests that perceptions of water quality result from a complex interaction of diverse factors. In many circumstances, the estimation of water quality is mostly influenced by organoleptic properties, in particular flavour. In addition, a variety of other factors also have an influence on perceptions of quality. These include risk perception, attitudes towards water chemicals, contextual cues provided by the supply system, familiarity with specific water properties, trust in suppliers, past problems attributed to water quality and information provided by the mass media and interpersonal sources. The role and relevance of these factors are discussed in detail},

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a quantitative technique for eliciting preferences that can be used in the absence of revealed preference data. The method involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios, goods or services. Each alternative is described by several attributes and the responses are used to determine whether preferences are significantly influenced by the attributes and also their relative importance. DCEs are widely used in high-income contexts and are increasingly being applied in low- and middle-income countries to consider a range of policy concerns. This paper aims to provide an introduction to DCEs for policy-makers and researchers with little knowledge of the technique. We outline the stages involved in undertaking a DCE, with an emphasis on the design considerations applicable in a low-income setting.},

Rainwater is abundant during the monsoonal wet season in the Mekong Delta, yet it becomes quite scarce during the dry season. Households with too few containers to collect and store sufficient rainwater must use groundwater or canal water during the dry season, or purchase water from a local vendor. Much of the groundwater and surface water in the region is polluted, yet households with limited income do not have access to a safe and affordable alternative. The potential health and welfare gains made possible by providing access to bottled water during the dry season are compelling, yet many households are too poor to pay for bottled water service. Many residents also prefer the taste of rainwater, and likely would not purchase bottled water, even at a low price, when rainwater is available. Thus, a commercial water bottling enterprise might not be financially viable in the region, due to inadequate ability and willingness to pay among households.},

Ethnographic research took place in five communities in Nampula, Mozambique, during a year when residents endured seasonal dry months and later received a water supply project. This research explores how gender roles and relations are impacted by changes in community water resources, and how these impacts are understood from local perspectives. In rural Mozambique, water collection and use are not only gendered activities, but also practices that shape marital relations and cultural notions of a good wife and mother.},

While costless preplay communication (cheap talk) has been found to be effective in experimental coordination games, participants have typically learned both own payoffs and the other player's action. Are both of these components necessary for cheap talk to be effective? In our 2×2 stag hunt game, the safe choice always yields the same payoff, so that information about payoffs does not always identify the other player's action. We vary whether information is provided about the other person's play, and whether costless one-way messages can be sent before action choices are made. We find that information provision about the other person's play increases coordination when there are messages, but otherwise has no effect. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Several common hypotheses for benefit transfer reliability were tested for the transfer of WTP estimates between the two communities, as well as between districts within Puntarenas. This study finds no basis for the claim that the reliability of benefit transfer increases with proximity between the study site where WTP estimates are taken from, and the policy site estimates are transferred to. The claim that transfer of WTP adjusted by the benefit function outperforms transfers of unadjusted or simple income-adjusted WTP is rejected for this particular study. Results also show that census-type socio-economic site characteristics are necessary, but not sufficient to explain site-specific differences in WTP. The trade-offs in designing valid and reliable benefit transfer studies with transferable results are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper updates a 1996 meta-analysis of studies using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to value threatened, endangered and rare species published in this journal by Loomis and White. A variable for studies conducted in or after 1995 was added to the model to test if new studies are systematically different from old studies and identify which explanatory variables influencing willingness-to-pay (WTP) for these species have changed over time. Generally newer studies yielded higher WTP. Variables such as the change in the size of the species population, payment frequency, survey mode, response rate, type of respondent, type of species, and a new variable for whether a species is a 'charismatic megafauna' or not, whether the species has use and nonuse value versus nonuse value only and year of the study, were found to significantly influence WTP. This model is used in a benefit transfer example and a comparison of original study estimates and model estimates is made to compare its accuracy. The average within sample benefit transfer error was 34-45%. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study used household survey data from four Kenyan towns to examine the effect of households' characteristics and risk perceptions on their decision to treat/filter water as well as on their choice of main drinking water source. Because the two decisions may be jointly made by the household, a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model was estimated. It turned out that treating non-piped water and using piped water as a main drinking water source were substitutes. The evidence supports the finding that perceived risks significantly correlate with a household's decision to treat non-piped water before drinking it. The study also found that higher connection fees reduced the likelihood of households connecting to the piped network. Because the current connection fee acts as a cost hurdle which deters households from getting a connection, the study recommends a system where households pay the connection fee in instalments, through a prepaid water scheme or through a subsidy scheme.},

@article{Doria2009,
abstract = {There is a growing effort to provide drinking water that has the trust of consumers, but the processes underlying the perception of drinking water quality and risks are still not fully understood. This paper intends to explore the factors involved in public perception of the quality and risks of drinking water. This purpose was addressed with a cross-national mixed-method approach, based on quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) data collected in the UK and Portugal. The data were analysed using several methods, including structural equation models and generalised linear models. Results suggest that perceptions of water quality and risk result from a complex interaction of diverse factors. The estimation of water quality is mostly influenced by satisfaction with organoleptic properties (especially flavour), risk perception, contextual cues, and perceptions of chemicals (lead, chlorine, and hardness). Risk perception is influenced by organoleptics, perceived water chemicals, external information, past health problems, and trust in water suppliers, among other factors. The use of tap and bottled water to drink was relatively well explained by regression analysis. Several cross-national differences were found and the implications are discussed. Suggestions for future research are provided. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a seldom recognized empirical puzzle. Much micro-econometric evidence suggests that precipitation has wide ranging impacts on vital economic indicators such as agricultural yields, human capital and even conflict. And yet paradoxically most macro-econometric evidence (especially in the climate economics literature) finds that precipitation has no robust and significant impact on various measures of aggregate economic output. Here, we argue that spatial aggregation of weather at the country level explains this result. We use annual sub-national GDP data to show a concave relationship between precipitation and local GDP growth between 1990 and 2014. We demonstrate that when data are aggregated at larger spatial scales, the significance of the impact decreases and eventually it vanishes. The impact of precipitation on aggregate economic activity is predominantly felt in developing countries and is insignificant in developed countries. Agriculture is found to be a key pathway. Our results have substantial consequences for measuring the economic impact of climate change.},

abstract = {Consumers in most developed countries, including Australia and New Zealand, presume their drinking water is safe. How social perceptions about drinking water are formed, however, remains inadequately explored in the research literature. This research contributes exploratory insights by examining factors that affect consumer perceptions and behaviors. Individual perceptions of drinking water quality and actions undertaken to mitigate perceived risks were collected during 183 face-to-face interviews conducted at six research sites. Qualitative thematic analysis revealed the majority did not consider drinking water a “risky” activity, trusted water management authorities to manage all safety issues and believed self-evaluation of drinking water's taste and appearance were sufficient measures to ensure safe consumption. Quantitatively, significant relationships emerged between water quality perceptions and sex, employment status, drinking water treatment and trust in government to provide safe water. Expert advice was rarely sought, even by those who believed drinking tap water posed some health risks. Generational differences emerged in media usage for drinking water advice. Finally, precautionary measures taken at home and abroad often failed to meet national drinking water guidelines. Three major conclusions are drawn: a. broad lack of awareness exists about the most suitable and safe water treatment activities, as well as risks posed; b. health literacy and interest may be improved through greater consumer involvement in watershed management; and c. development of health campaigns that clearly communicate drinking water safety messages in a timely, relevant and easily understandable fashion may help mitigate actual risks and dispel myths.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acceptance and long-term sustainability of water quality interventions are pivotal to realizing continued health benefits. However, there is limited research attempting to understand the factors that influence compliance to or adoption of such interventions.\n\nMETHODS: Eight focus group discussions with parents of young children--including compliant and not compliant households participating in an intervention study, and three key-informant interviews with village headmen were conducted between April and May 2014 to understand perceptions on the effects of unsafe water on health, household drinking water treatment practices, and the factors influencing acceptance and sustainability of an ongoing water quality intervention in a rural population of southern India.\n\nRESULTS: The ability to recognize health benefits from the intervention, ease of access to water distribution centers and the willingness to pay for intervention maintenance were factors facilitating acceptance and sustainability of the water quality intervention. On the other hand, faulty perceptions on water treatment, lack of knowledge about health hazards associated with drinking unsafe water, false sense of protection from locally available water, resistance to change in taste or odor of water and a lack of support from male members of the household were important factors impeding acceptance and long term use of the intervention.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights the need to effectively involve communities at important stages of implementation for long term success of water quality interventions. Timely research on the factors influencing uptake of water quality interventions prior to implementation will ensure greater acceptance and sustainability of such interventions in low income settings.},

abstract = {The study focused on impact of water scarcity and drudgery of water collection on women's health in Ogun state Nigeria. Simple random sampling technique was used to select 120 respondents (women) in the study areas. Data were analyzed using both descriptive statistics and Pearsons Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMC). Finding showed that the mean age of the respondents was 35.09 years. The most striking risks of water scarcity on the health of respondents are waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid fever, Guinea worm, hookworm, and bilharzia (19.81 percent). It affects farm work (17.39), tiredness (15.94), and low yield from farming activities (14.25 percent). The major source (27.46 percent) of water to the women in the study area is boreholes. Majority (79.2 percent) of the respondents opined that they feel tired after water collection. Correlation showed significant relationship between daily trip and duration of trekking to sources of water (r=.24**; N=115 P<0.01) and a very strong relationship of P=0.00 (P<0.01). and between duration of trekking and women's household size (r=.26*, N=115, P<0.05) and a very strong relationship of P=0.00 (P<0.05). Increased level of access of women to best sources of water supply would assist in the maximization of their potential; reduce stress and diseases that are a result of lack of potable water.},

abstract = {Researchers have long recognized that subjective perceptions of risk are better predictors of choices over risky outcomes than science-based or experts' assessments of risk. More recent work suggests that uncertainty about risks also plays a role in predicting choices and behavior. In this article, we develop and estimate a formal model for an individual's perceived health risks associated with arsenic contamination of his or her drinking water. The modeling approach treats risk as a random variable, with an estimable probability distribution whose variance reflects uncertainty. The model we estimate uses data collected from a survey given to a sample of people living in arsenic-prone areas in the United States. The findings from this article support the fact that scientific information is essential to explaining the mortality rate perceived by the individuals, but uncertainty about the probability remains significant.

abstract = {The use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) has increased rapidly in recent years and debate has focused on whether health insurance should cover the procedure. We developed and disseminated a contingent valuation survey to investigate how individuals value IVF treatment. Couples pursuing in vitro fertilization can be viewed as purchasing an increased probability of conceiving and bearing a child. In our survey, respondents were asked if they would pay stated amounts for IVF, under various assumptions about the probability of success. The survey explores the ex post perspective, (respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) for IVF in the event that they are infertile), the ex ante perspective, (WTP for IVF insurance, assuming respondents do not know their infertility status), WTP for a public IVF program, and how respondents value IVF relative to mortality risk reduction. Among 150 respondents who were potential childbearers, average WTP was $17,730 for a 10% chance at having a child through IVF in the event of infertility. Average WTP was $865 for a lifetime insurance benefit providing access to a 10% chance. Among 231 respondents of all ages, average WTP was $32 per year in taxes for a public program giving 1,200 couples per year in Massachusetts a 10% chance. The estimated implied ex post WTP per statistical baby was $177,730, while ex ante WTP per statistical baby was $1.8 million. The results of regression analyses were consistent with theoretical predictions, (e.g., increasing WTP with household income). The contingent valuation method is a potentially useful tool in understanding how people value the benefits of IVF. Further research is needed to test the validity of this methodology.},

This article reviews and presents evidence on the effectiveness of these ex ante and ex post approaches. The ex ante approaches lead to recommendations to modify survey designs to minimize the bias up front.

Several studies have been carried out to analyze people's perception and attitude about the drinking water coming from their water distribution systems. The goal of the present study is to investigate the influence of water quality and the geographic location of consumers within a distribution system on consumer perception of tap water. The study is based on the data obtained from two surveys carried out in municipalities of the Quebec City area (Canada). Three perception variables were used to study consumer perception: general satisfaction, taste satisfaction and risk perception. Data analysis based on logistic regression indicates that water quality variations and geographic location in the distribution system have a significant impact on the consumer perception. This impact appears to be strongly associated with residual chlorine levels.

abstract = {High-level, integrated watershed assessments are a basic requirement for freshwater planning, as they create regional summaries of multiple environmental stressors for the prioritization of watershed conservation, restoration, monitoring, and mitigation. There is a heightened need for a high-level, integrated watershed assessment in Nova Scotia as it faces pressing watershed issues relating to acidification, soil erosion, acid rock drainage, eutrophication, and water withdrawals related to potential shale gas development. But because of the relative sparseness of the on-the-ground effects-based data, for example on water quality or fish assemblages, previously created approaches for integrated watershed assessment cannot be used. In a government/university collaboration, we developed a new approach that relies solely on easier-to-collect and more available exposure-based variables to perform the first high-level watershed assessment in Nova Scotia. In this assessment, a total of 295 watershed units were studied. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map and analyze 13 stressor variables that represent risks to aquatic environment (e.g., road/stream crossing density, acid rock drainage risk, surface water withdrawals, human land use, and dam density). We developed a model to link stressors with impacts to aquatic systems to serve as a basis for a watershed threat ranking system. Resource management activities performed by government and other stakeholders were also included in this analysis. Our assessment identifies the most threatened watersheds, enables informed comparisons among watersheds, and indicates where to focus resource management and monitoring efforts. Stakeholder communication tools produced by the NSWAP include a watershed atlas to communicate the assessment results to a broader audience, including policy makers and public stakeholders. This new framework for high-level watershed assessments provides a resource for other regions that also have limited availability of effects-based data, an important consideration as expanding human activities impact water resources in less densely monitored regions.},

Our meta-regressions identify several important findings, including: (1) the median absolute error is 39%; (2) function transfers outperform value transfers; (3) transfers describing environmental quantity generate lower transfer errors than transfers describing quality changes; (4) geographic site similarity is important for value transfers; (5) contingent valuation generates lower transfer errors than other valuation methods; and (6) combining data from multiple studies tends to reduce transfer errors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Nonmarket valuation, i.e., valuing environmental goods and services that are not traded in a market, has been increasingly used in a variety of policy and decision-making contexts. This is one (but not the only) way that researchers and practitioners have sought to define and measure the values that individuals assign to environmental goods and services. The idea of putting a dollar value on protecting the environment has been controversial, but often because the economic approach to valuation has not been well-understood. This chapter provides a nontechnical overview of and rationale for the economic approach to valuation, starting from a broad conceptualization of values versus valuation. It summarizes the economic concept of value and its key features. It then discusses the use of economic valu- ation in decision making, followed by an overview of the steps involved in the valuation process and important issues that arise in implementing that process. Finally, it identifies and briefly summarizes the principal non-market valuation methods used by economists. In doing so, it sets the stage for the more detailed chapters},

As we were unable to observe preferences via an incentive compatible mechanism, we collected voluntary contributions toward the provision of the good. We make a case for interpreting these contributions as a ‘‘theoretical lower bound'' on the value of the public good and estimate the lower bound. We also investigate whether we can use contingent donation data to estimate such lower bounds on values. We used a follow-up to the contingent donation question about the respondent's level of certainty with respect to her response to the contingent donation question. The results of this study suggest that use of the follow-up certainty question to differentiate respondents who would actually donate from those who would not is a promising approach to estimating a lower bound to Hicksian surplus measures.},

We find that the choice of water source is strongly influenced by a number of household characteristics, as well as distance to sources. There are also strong substitution effects across sources. For example, increasing the distance to a public tap by 1 km increases the probability of using a well by 43 per cent in urban areas. With regards to time spent gathering water, we focus on the effects of gender, age, and distance to water. Women and girls spend the most time gathering water. The response to reducing distance to water sources differs in rural and urban areas, as well as by gender and age of household members. Investments to reduce to the distance to water sources will have larger impacts on adults than children, and on men than women.},

Ethnographic research took place in five communities in Nampula, Mozambique, during a year when residents endured seasonal dry months and later received a water supply project. This research explores how gender roles and relations are impacted by changes in community water resources, and how these impacts are understood from local perspectives. In rural Mozambique, water collection and use are not only gendered activities, but also practices that shape marital relations and cultural notions of a good wife and mother.},

abstract = {The first edition of this important work was the winner of the 2002 Publication of Enduring Quality award by the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists. The continuing premise for the book is that estimates of the economic values of environmental and natural resource services are essential for effective policy-making. Like previous editions, the third edition, which includes two additional co-authors, presents a comprehensive treatment of the theory and methods involved in estimating environmental benefits. Researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners will welcome the work as an up-to-date reference on recent developments. Students will gain a better understanding of the contribution that economics as a discipline can make to decisions concerning pollution control and human health, recreation, environmental amenities, and other critical issues concerning the way we use and interact with environmental and natural resource systems. To reflect recent progress in both the theory and practice of non-market valuation, this third edition includes more details on empirical approaches to measurement, expanded discussion of the reasons for divergence between " willingness to pay " and " willingness to accept compensation, " and increased coverage of econometric issues encountered in estimation. In keeping with its cutting-edge orientation, it also includes more discussion of survey design, equilibrium sorting models, and the implications of behavioral economics for welfare measurements and benefit cost analysis. Resources for the Future (RFF) improves environmental and natural resource policymaking worldwide through independent social science research of the highest caliber. Founded in 1952, RFF pioneered the application of economics as a tool for developing more effective policy about the use and conservation of natural resources. Its scholars continue to employ social science methods to analyze critical issues concerning pollution control, energy policy, land and water use, hazardous waste, climate change, biodiversity, and the environmental challenges of developing countries. RFF Press supports the mission of RFF by publishing book-length works that present a broad range of approaches to the study of natural resources and the environment. Its authors and editors include RFF staff, researchers from the larger academic and policy communities, and journalists. Audiences for publications by RFF Press include all of the participants in the policymaking process—scholars, the media, advocacy groups, NGOs, professionals in business and government, and the public.},

We evaluate how coping costs and {WTP} vary across types of water users and income. We find that households in Kathmandu Valley engage in five main types of coping behaviors: collecting, pumping, treating, storing, and purchasing. These activities impose coping costs on an average household of as much as 3 {U.S.} dollars per month or about 1% of current incomes, representing hidden but real costs of poor infrastructure service. We find that these coping costs are almost twice as much as the current monthly bills paid to the water utility but are significantly lower than estimates of {WTP} for improved services. We find that coping costs are statistically correlated with {WTP} and several household characteristics.},

Most benefit transfer studies to date have been conducted behind closed doors and have not been open to scholarly review, and no systematic research agenda has been established to determine whether benefit transfer estimates are valid for public policy analyses. In this paper we propose a systematic, conceptual foundation for conducting benefit transfer studies, and suggest a research agenda to identify conditions under which valid benefit transfer estimates can be derived. We conclude, however, that this research agenda must be accompanied by improved conduct and reporting of original valuation studies before benefit transfer can become a widely used tool in public policy analyses.

@article{Loomis1992,
abstract = {The desire for economic values of recreation for unstudied recreation resources dates back to the water resource development benefit‐cost analyses of the early 1960s. Rather than simply applying existing estimates of benefits per trip to the study site, a fairly rigorous approach was developed by a number of economists. This approach involves application of travel cost demand equations and contingent valuation benefit functions from existing sites to the new site. In this way the spatial market of the new site (i.e., its differing own price, substitute prices and population distribution) is accounted for in the new estimate of total recreation benefits. The assumptions of benefit transfer from recreation sites in one state to another state for the same recreation activity is empirically tested. The equality of demand coefficients for ocean sport salmon fishing in Oregon versus Washington and for freshwater steelhead fishing in Oregon versus Idaho is rejected. Thus transfer of either demand equations or average benefits per trip are likely to be in error. Using the Oregon steelhead equation, benefit transfers to rivers within the state are shown to be accurate to within 5–15%. Copyright 1992 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {From the moment of its inception, human choice about how to treat the environment is a key part of ecological restoration. Because many, if not most, restoration projects require continual management once established, human choice remains a vital component of restoration projects for their entire life. But ecological restorationists often downplay the role of choice in restoration, partly because we see the choice to restore as obvious and inherently good and partly because we feel the restoration of more natural conditions for a habitat will lessen the impact of human choice over time. Some critics feel the role of human choice in restoration degrades the value of restoration. However, another response to human choice in restoration is to embrace choice, even with the problems it brings, and use choice as a way to more fully engage humans with the environment. If such choices are approached carefully, with recognition of the potential for poor choices, then restorationists can arrive at restorations that are better for both the environment and us. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) is potentially ground-breaking legislation. It seeks to bring about improvement of aquatic habitats in Europe to 'good ecological status', defined as slightly different from 'high ecological status', with no or minimal human impact. The characteristics of pristine ecological status include nutrient parsimony, a defined characteristic structure of the system (including geomorphological structure and hydrology, biological and food web structure) and the connectivity and extent of the system that are essential for resilience to change. This modern ecological understanding is being ignored by government agencies charged with enacting the Directive. Schemes are being devised that measure secondary characteristics of habitats using approaches drawn from traditional water quality management. Typologies, indicated by the Directive to give a geographical basis within which to determine ecological status, are also being corrupted with different typologies used for different determinands. The ecological reality of reasonably distinctive, integrated systems (an erosive upland river versus a floodplain system, for example) is being avoided. Emphasis is being placed on precision of measurement of specific determinands rather than accuracy in what is being measured and proposed schemes are complex and expensive when accurate assessment could be carried out much more cheaply. Many are also likely to become redundant as effects of climate change take hold. The current approach will lead to some improvement in water quality but not to the fundamental change in ecological quality intended by the Directive and has partly been encouraged by lack of definition and contradictions within the Directive itself. Documented details currently available from the UK agencies are used to illustrate how the intentions of the Directive are being undermined for ostensibly political convenience through processes of redefinition and limitation of characteristics measured. There appears to be a parallel concern among official and non-governmental European bodies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the following, this special issue provides seven specific papers that highlight and discuss the effects of restoration on the investigated river–floodplain systems. Additionally, restoration success was estimated from a socio-economic perspective. The first part of this paper presents the overall study concept and the general sampling design of the field investigations. Each study site was examined with the same array of methods, covering habitat composition in the river and its floodplain, three aquatic and two floodplain-related organism groups, as well as food web composition and “aquatic terrestrial” interactions as reflected by stable isotopes. An overview of the rivers and the study sites summarizes main attributes of all investigated sites, with emphasis on the large-scale restoration projects. Some of the projects represent the “state of the art” restoration approaches for two major European river types: gravel-bed mountain rivers and sand-bed lowland rivers. Concluding, restoration efforts had positive effects even in the small restoration projects investigated but did not increase with project size. No “single best” measure could be identified, but river widening generally had a larger effect compared to other restoration measures.},

abstract = {Extensive degradation of ecosystems, combined with the increasing demands placed on the goods and services they provide, is a major driver of biodiversity loss on a global scale. In particular, the severe degradation of large rivers, their catchments, floodplains and lower estuarine reaches has been ongoing for many centuries, and the consequences are evident across Europe. River restoration is a relatively recent tool that has been brought to bear in attempts to reverse the effects of habitat simplification and ecosystem degradation, with a surge of projects undertaken in the 1990s in Europe and elsewhere, mainly North America. Here, we focus on restoration of the physical properties (e.g. substrate composition, bank and bed structure) of river ecosystems to ascertain what has, and what has not, been learned over the last 20. years.First, we focus on three common types of restoration measures-riparian buffer management, instream mesohabitat enhancement and the removal of weirs and small dams-to provide a structured overview of the literature. We distinguish between abiotic effects of restoration (e.g. increasing habitat diversity) and biological recovery (e.g. responses of algae, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fishes).We then addressed four major questions: (i) Which organisms show clear recovery after restoration? (ii) Is there evidence for qualitative linkages between restoration and recovery? (iii) What is the timescale of recovery? and (iv) What are the reasons, if restoration fails?Overall, riparian buffer zones reduced fine sediment entry, and nutrient and pesticide inflows, and positive effects on stream organisms were evident. Buffer width and length were key: 5-30. m width and > 1 km length were most effective. The introduction of large woody debris, boulders and gravel were the most commonly used restoration measures, but the potential positive effects of such local habitat enhancement schemes were often likely to be swamped by larger-scale geomorphological and physico-chemical effects. Studies demonstrating long-term biological recovery due to habitat enhancement were notable by their absence. In contrast, weir removal can have clear beneficial effects, although biological recovery might lag behind for several years, as huge amounts of fine sediment may have accumulated upstream of the former barrier.Three Danish restoration schemes are provided as focal case studies to supplement the literature review and largely supported our findings. While the large-scale re-meandering and re-establishment of water levels at River Skjern resulted in significant recovery of riverine biota, habitat enhancement schemes at smaller-scales in other rivers were largely ineffective and failed to show long-term recovery.The general lack of knowledge derived from integrated, well-designed and long-term restoration schemes is striking, and we present a conceptual framework to help address this problem. The framework was applied to the three restoration types included in our study and highlights recurrent cause-effect chains, that is, commonly observed relationships of restoration measures (cause) and their effects on abiotic and biotic conditions (effect). Such conceptual models can provide useful new tools for devising more effective river restoration, and for identifying avenues for future research in restoration ecology in general. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on 44 French pilot projects that included such an evaluation, the present study includes: 1) an introduction to restoration projects based on their general characteristics 2) a description of evaluation strategies and authorities in charge of their implementation, and 3) a focus on the evaluation of results and the links between these results and evaluation strategies. The results show that: 1) the quality of an evaluation strategy often remains too poor to understand well the link between a restoration project and ecological changes; 2) in many cases, the conclusions drawn are contradictory, making it difficult to determine the success or failure of a restoration project; and 3) the projects with the poorest evaluation strategies generally have the most positive conclusions about the effects of restoration. Recommendations are that evaluation strategies should be designed early in the project planning process and be based on clearly-defined objectives. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The reasons ecosystems should be restored are numerous, disparate, generally understated, and commonly underappreciated. We offer a typology in which these reasons - or motivations - are ordered among five rationales: technocratic, biotic, heuristic, idealistic, and pragmatic. The technocratic rationale encompasses restoration that is conducted by government agencies or other large organizations to satisfy specific institutional missions and mandates. The biotic rationale for restoration is to recover lost aspects of local biodiversity. The heuristic rationale attempts to elicit or demonstrate ecological principles and biotic expressions. The idealistic rationale consists of personal and cultural expressions of concern or atonement for environmental degradation, reengagement with nature, and/or spiritual fulfillment. The pragmatic rationale seeks to recover or repair ecosystems for their capacity to provide a broad array of natural services and products upon which human economies depend and to counteract extremes in climate caused by ecosystem loss. We propose that technocratic restoration, as currently conceived and practiced, is too narrow in scope and should be broadened to include the pragmatic rationale whose overarching importance is just beginning to be recognized. We suggest that technocratic restoration is too authoritarian, that idealistic restoration is overly restricted by lack of administrative strengths, and that a melding of the two approaches would benefit both. Three recent examples are given of restoration that blends the technocratic, idealistic, and pragmatic rationales and demonstrates the potential for a more unified approach. The biotic and heuristic rationales can be satisfied within the contexts of the other rationales. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {For the growing body of academic and policy research on the energy-water nexus, the case of Brazil is particularly important and interesting. Brazil has a large biofuel crop industry that makes use of extensive water resources. The country's large oil industry uses and disposes of large quantities of water, and hydropower is the nation's largest single source of electric power. Each of these elements of the energy system implicates different aspects of Brazil's policy and regulatory systems for managing water resources.  This essay, which reviews the experience managing the intersection of Brazil's energy and water issues, makes five arguments. First, as a federal system one of the most important policy issues in Brazil is the allocation of authority between the federal government and the many varied state regulatory systems that affect water. There is huge variation in state-level regulation; the most sophisticated of these systems is that of S{\~{a}}o Paulo — the state where we focus in this case study. Second, in terms of sheer volume of water consumed, Brazil's sugar crops have a huge impact on the country's water-energy nexus. However, as a practical matter, most of the sugar crop is not much affected by water policy because it is rain fed — as in most countries, water uses that affect rainfall are not much regulated whereas irrigated water is under much stricter control. Third, much of Brazil's river system crosses state boundaries, raising potential concerns about lack of policy coordination. A system of river basin committees is designed to ameliorate those concerns — however, for the most part, those committees have little practical impact on policy. Nationally, there is huge variation in the actual implementation of water laws; only three regions in the most economically developed areas of the country have implemented essentially all of the nation's administrative framework for managing water.  Fourth, we note that in theory different water-using sectors could allow for fungibility in water usage and pollution control costs across the sectors. In practice, however, a wide array of organizational and legal rigidities makes that impractical. The oil and gas sector, for example, is managed using policy and regulatory frameworks that are completely separate from other water using sectors. Fifth, and finally, we note that use of water flow for generating electricity is of paramount importance in Brazil due to the country's dependence on hydroelectricity. For years it has been known that this use of water is under-priced and under-regulated — mainly because of the close relationship between the hydroelectric sector and its regulatory bodies. There have been very limited use of market forces to encourage more efficient water behavior. In addition to some limited efforts to use water pricing, there are also auspicious experiments under way to use ecosystem services to put a proper value on watersheds. Other ideas, including smarter pricing of water flow, have been around for years yet still have had limited practical impact due to an array of political barriers we describe.},

In terms of ecology, the concepts of good structure and function reflect a resilient ecosystem with a high level of adaptive capacity. However, the legal provisions of the Directive compromise this concept. The Directive's approach assumes that by quantifying certain fixed biological elements it is possible to accurately assess the structure and function of ecosystems. This approach is highly contestable, and undermines the possibility of attaining the objective of good ecological status. To improve the possibility of achieving good ecological status, we emphasise the need to first redefine high ecological status as a state wherein the ecosystems maintain themselves independently of management; secondly, that the hydrological regime be addressed when assessing the bodies of water; and, thirdly, that traits, rather than the current quality elements be used as variables.},

In the UK and Europe, the period after the implementation of the Water Framework Directive is marked by a clear shift to a more ecological framing of river restoration. The increasing ecological focus of stated goals for restoration, and its use as a tool to fulfill legislative requirements, places a greater emphasis on the need for appropriate restoration design, monitoring, and appraisal to clearly demonstrate the ecological benefits of restoration projects. The role of restoration as a community-based activity is increasingly important, and citizen science monitoring frameworks, together with reanalysis of existing datasets provide an opportunity to increase the knowledge-base supporting river restoration, and to integrate restoration motives and drivers with project design and evaluation. Blended participatory approaches and an ecosystem goods and services approach encourage this kind of integration, but will be effective only if conflicts between stakeholders with differing worldviews and objectives can be identified and managed.},

Here we review the successes and problems encountered with implementation of the WFD over the past 10. years and provide recommendations to further improve the implementation process. We particularly address three fields: (i) the development of assessment methods (including reference conditions, typologies and intercalibration); (ii) the implementation of assessment systems in monitoring programmes; and (iii) the consequences for river basin management plans (such as the design, monitoring and success of restoration measures).The development of assessment methods has been a transparent process and has resulted in improved and more standardised tools for assessing water bodies across Europe. The process has been more time consuming, and methods are more complex, than originally expected. Future challenges still remain, including the estimation of uncertainty of assessment results and a revision of rules in combining the results obtained with different Biological Quality Elements.A huge amount of monitoring data is now being generated for WFD purposes. Monitoring data are not centrally stored and thus poorly accessible for purposes beyond the WFD. Future challenges include enhanced data accessibility and the establishment of a Europe-wide central monitoring network of reference sites.The WFD river basin management plans base management decisions on the response of aquatic organisms to environmental stress. In contrast to the effects of degradation, the biotic response to restoration is less well-known and poorly predictable. The timescale of the WFD (obtaining good ecological status in all surface waters by 2027) is over-ambitious. Future challenges include long-term monitoring of restoration measures to understand the requirements for ecosystems to recover and prioritisation of measures according to re-colonisation potential. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reviews historical and existing drought and water policy in Australia in order to gain a sense of the strengths and weaknesses in enabling effective adaptation to climate change. In particular, (a) the social, economic, and environmental costs and benefits of water trading and (b) the limitations of using 'market-based' instruments (MBIs), like water trading, for adapting to drought and water security related climate change impacts are investigated. It was found that water trading has potential as a climate change adaptation strategy with many benefits experienced in previous and current versions of water trading. However, there are also limitations and those negatively impacted by water trading are hit hard. These social impacts of water trading have not been thoroughly investigated and are not well understood. Significant uncertainty also exists around the impacts of water trading on the environment (e.g. changed hydrological regimes, underestimation of sustainable environmental flows etc.). Proper quantification of these impacts is needed, however, it is a complex task given Australia's large hydroclimatic variability and the current lack of understanding as to how to optimise water needs of the environment, humans, agriculture and other industries. It appears that 'cap and trade' quantity-based MBIs such as water trading will eventually do what they are designed to do (i.e. reallocate a resource to 'high value' users). However, given that the 'low value' users in this case are agriculture and town/urban water supply (not including drinking water) and the 'high value' users are mining, manufacturing, and electricity production (i.e. high greenhouse gas emissions), do we really want the water trading MBI to achieve its objective? And, what would the social and environmental ramifications of such a shift in water use within Australia be? These questions, along with the limitations and potential implications of using water trading (and MBIs in general) as a climate change adaptation tool, must be carefully considered if past Australian drought and water policy failures are not to be repeated. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.},

Herein, several active and passive bioindication approaches are reviewed in light of existing legal frameworks, current targets and applicable implementation of river restoration. Such approaches should move from the use of single biological indicators to more holistic ecological indicators simultaneously addressing communities, multiple life stages and habitat properties such as water quality, substrate composition and stream channel morphology. The proposed Proceeding Chain of Restoration (PCoR) can enable the integration of natural scientific, political and socioeconomic dimensions for restoration of aquatic ecosystems and associated services. Generally, an analysis that combines target species-based active bioindication with community-based passive bioindication and multivariate statistics seems to be most suitable for a holistic evaluation of restoration success, as well as for the monitoring of stream ecosystem health. Since the response of biological communities to changing environmental conditions can differ between taxonomic groups and rivers, assessments at the ecosystem scale should include several levels of biological organisation. A stepwise evaluation of the primary factors inducing disturbance or degradation is needed to integrate increasing levels of complexity from water quality assessments to the evaluation of ecological function. The proposed PCoR can provide a step-by-step guide for restoration ecologists, comprising all planning steps from the determination of the conservation objectives to the use of ecological indicators in post-restoration monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study quantifies local improvements in environmental quality from controlling effluents in the pulp and paper industry. Although it is confined to a single industry, this study is the first effort to assess the actual net benefits of the Clean Water Act pollution control program. An assessment of water quality benefits requires linking regulatory policy, technical effects, and behavioral responses. Regulatory policies mandate specific controls that influence the quantity and nature of effluent discharges. We identify a subset of stream segments suitable for analysis, describe water quality simulations and control cost calculations under alternative regulatory scenarios, assign feasible water uses to each segment based on water quality, and determine probable upper bounds for the willingness of beneficiaries to pay. Because the act imposes uniform regulations that do not account for differences in compliance costs, existing stream quality, contributions of other effluent sources, and recreation potential, the relation between water quality benefits and costs varies widely across sites. This variation suggests that significant positive net benefits have probably been achieved in some cases, but we conclude that the costs of the Clean Water Act as a whole exceed likely benefits by a significant margin.

Centuries of intensive exploitation of the ecosystem services, urbanization, and water management focusing on the use of water and safeguarding humans from floods and diseases, rather than on ecological health, have led to severe degradations and functional losses. In recent years, restoration has been recognized as essential to reestablish the quality of the rivers and an increasing number of restoration projects have been implemented. In Europe, the Water Framework Directive orchestrates restoration efforts, and demands that all water bodies achieve their good ecological status or potential. In urban areas, most rivers are heavily impacted by human activities and social demand for restoration is high. However, little knowledge exists about urban restoration practices. This research aims (1) to identify the different restoration practices and drivers, and examine the particularities of urban river restorations, and (2) to assess the potential conflicts inside the socio-ecological system.

abstract = {The culturally and ecologically diverse region of the Eastern Himalayas is the target of ambitious hydropower development plans. Policy discourses at national and international levels position this development as synergistically positive: it combines the production of clean energy to fuel economic growth at regional and national levels with initiatives to lift poor mountain communities out of poverty. Different from hydropower development in the 20th century in which development agencies and banks were important players, contemporary initiatives importantly rely on the involvement of private actors, with a prominent role of the private finance sector. This implies that hydropower development is not only financially viable but also understood as highly profitable. This paper examines the new development of hydropower in the Eastern Himalaya of Nepal and India. It questions its framing as green energy, interrogates its links with climate change, and examines its potential for investment and capital accumulation. To do this, we also review the evidence on the extent to which its construction and operation may modify existing hydrogeological processes and ecosystems, as well as its impacts on the livelihoods of diverse groups of people that depend on these. The paper concludes that hydropower development in the region is characterised by inherent contentions and uncertainties, refuting the idea that dams constitute development projects whose impacts can be simply predicted, controlled and mitigated. Indeed, in a highly complex geological, ecological, cultural and political context that is widely regarded to be especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, hydropower as a development strategy makes for a toxic cocktail.},

abstract = {The main objectives of the paper are to (1) give an overview of the state of the art of environmental value transfer, (2) discuss its prospects and potential role in CBA as a decision-support tool, and (3) provide further guidelines for proper use and application. Environmental value or benefit transfer is a technique in which the results of studies on monetary environmental valuation are applied to new policy contexts. The technique is controversial, not least because of academic and political reservations over the usefulness and technical feasibility of economic valuation tools to demonstrate the importance of environmental values in project or programme appraisals. Testing of environmental value transfer so far has been unable to validate the practice. Taking into account the conditions set out in the literature for valid and reliable value transfer, most transfers appear to result in substantial transfer errors. This paper discusses why and addresses the question of which factors may have been overlooked. It is argued that the problem is much more fundamental than previously acknowledged. Strict guidelines in terms of quantitative adjustment mechanisms to valid value transfer are meaningless if the more fundamental issue of differences in the very nature of the values elicited is not addressed at the same time.},

These ecosystem services were dilution of wastewater, natural purification of water, erosion control, habitat for fish and wildlife, and recreation. Households were asked a dichotomous choice willingness to pay question regarding purchasing the increase in ecosystem services through a higher water bill. Results from nearly 100 in-person interviews indicate that households would pay an average of $21 per month or $252 annually for the additional ecosystem services. Generalizing this to the households living along the river yields a value of $19 million to $70 million depending on whether those refusing to be interviewed have a zero value or not. Even the lower bound benefit estimates exceed the high estimate of water leasing costs ($1.13 million) and conservation reserve program farmland easements costs ($12.3 million) necessary to produce the increase in ecosystem services.

Public restoration benefits are not well quantified, nor are public preferences among diverse activities falling into the broad category ‘‘restoration.'' Our study estimates public values for restoration on the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico. Stakeholder meetings and public focus groups guided development of a restoration survey mailed to Albuquerque area households. Four restoration categories were defined: fish and wildlife; vegetation density; tree type; and natural river processes. Survey responses supplied data for both choice experiment (CE) and contingent valuation (CV) analyses, two established environmental economics techniques for quantifying public benefits of conservation policies. Full restoration benefits are estimated at over $150 per household per year via the CE and at nearly $50 per household per year via CV. The CE allows value disaggregation among different restoration categories. The most highly valued category was tree type, meaning reestablishing native tree dominance for such species as Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and eradicating non-native trees such as Saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissma). The high public values we have found for restoration offer economic justification for intensive riparian management, particularly native plant-based restoration in the Southwest.},

Our investigations show that after commissioning all the projects, 52–88% of the free-flowing river stretches will be diverted and 7.6–24% of the riverine ecosystems will be converted into semi lacustrine ecosystems in different rivers. The cascade hydropower development is likely to affect more than 100 fish species.

abstract = {Hydroelectric dams have social, cultural, and environmental impacts on society through both alterations of riverine effects (both downstream and in reservoirs) and the production and distribution of hydropower in a broader geographical area. Management of complex dam, hydroelectric, and river systems frequently requires tradeoffs between alternative operational profiles, each with its own set of heterogeneous external effects. Substantial evidence suggests that segments of the public hold non-market values, including non-use values, for both riverine environmental effects and a wide array of external effects of hydropower production and distribution. However, non-market non-use valuation exercises related to re-purposing dam operations continue to focus exclusively on downstream external effects, calling into question their usefulness in decision-making processes. Focusing on the Glen Canyon Dam (GCD), a critical source of hydropower and peaking capacity on the Colorado River, US, we measure non-market values, expected to be significantly composed of non-use values, using the contingent valuation (CV) method for two proposed management options inclusive of multiple social, cultural, and environmental effects of both downstream riverine effects and hydropower production and distribution in the broader basin. To provide a defensible basis for inclusion of relevant external effects in the valuation exercise, we undertook a multi-year study of the GCD policy domain. Using a nationally-representative, address-based CV internet survey, results from an advisory referendum voting format suggest that the average US household has a median net willingness to pay (WTP) to continue existing GCD operations of $21.51 per year [95% CI: $2.98, $40.04] after accounting for WTP to change operations under the US Department of Interior's preferred alternative. Net non-market value for continuing operations is $2.9 billion per year, aggregating across US households.},

@article{Lewis2008,
abstract = {This article presents the results of a hedonic property value analysis for multiple hydropower sites along the Kennebec River in Maine, including the former site of the Edwards Dam in Augusta, Maine. The effect of the removal of the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River in Maine is examined through consumer's marginal willingness to pay to be close to or distant from the dam site. Data from both before and after the dam was removed are used to estimate changes in marginal prices. A similar data set is also used to look at the effects of the remaining upstream dams on property values. This article presents one of the first (to our knowledge) ex post analyses on the economic impact of dam removal on property values. As more privately owned dams in the United States come up for relicensing, evaluating the impacts with and without the dam will become increasingly important. This work can help inform those analyses. (JEL Q25, Q51, Q58) {\textcopyright} 2008 Western Economic Association International.},

@article{Brouwer2016,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to estimate the non-market benefits of ecological river restoration and test their transferability across the second largest river basin in Europe. River restoration reduces flood risk and improves water quality, the welfare impacts of which are measured in an identical choice experiment conducted in three Danube river basin countries: Austria, Hungary and Romania. The estimated choice models differ in preference and scale parameters. Distance-decay effects are detected for water quality improvements in Austria and Romania and for a reduction in flood risk in Austria. Public perception of current water quality affects the value people attach to further improvements in water quality levels in all three countries. Controlling for these influencing factors, the estimated non-market benefits of river restoration policy scenarios appear to be transferable between Hungary and Romania, but not between Austria and Hungary and Austria and Romania. Given the role of location specific factors such as differences in population density and degree of urbanization, the use of a generally applicable research design seems a necessary, but insufficient precondition to reduce transfer errors when applying existing estimates of the non-market benefits of river restoration from the international literature to new river restoration contexts.},

The article considers the current state and scope of small and medium business, as well as the possibilities of its development in the future. Particular attention is paid to the creation of an SME enterprise around new innovative enterprises using various types of business cooperation. At the same time, recommendations on the use of the state support mechanism to accelerate the growth of SMEs in the production sector and the full realization of its technical, production and socio-economic potential are proposed. For a more complete picture of the impact of small and medium enterprises on the economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan, a regression model was constructed describing the influence of the number of active SMEs and the volume of loans issued by banks to SMEs on the SME output.},
