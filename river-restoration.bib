abstract = {The economic value of restoring Deckers Creek in Monongalia and Preston counties of West Virginia was determined from mail, Internet, and personal contact surveys. Multiattribute, choice experiments were conducted and nested logit models were estimated to derive the economic values of full restoration for three attributes of this creek: aquatic life, swimming, and scenic quality. Their relative economic values were that aquatic life > scenic quality ≈ swimming. These economic values imply that respondents had the highest value for aquatic life when fully restoring Deckers Creek to a sustainable fishery rather than a “put and take” fishery that cannot sustain fish populations. The welfare improvement estimates for full restoration of all three attributes ranged between $12 and $16 per month per household. Potential stream users (anglers) had the largest welfare gain from restoration, while nonangler respondents had the lowest. When these estimates were aggregated up to the entire watershed population, the benefit from restoration of Deckers Creek was estimated to be about $1.9 million annually. This benefit does not account for any economic values from partial stream restoration. On the basis of log likelihood tests of the nested logit models, two subsamples of the survey population (the general population and stream users) were found to be from the same population. Thus restoration choices by stream users may be representative of the watershed population, although the sample size of stream users was small in this research. },

abstract = {Teesta river basin in Eastern Himalaya is being subjected to cascade hydropower development. To assess the impacts of this developmental activity on fish fauna of the basin, fish habitats of the four largest tributaries in the basin were selected for the present study. A total of 18 large hydroelectric projects are planned on these rivers. Here, a total of 11 EIAs and 2 carrying capacity studies in Teesta basin were reviewed. Our investigations show that after commissioning all the projects, 52–88% of the free-flowing river stretches will be diverted and 7.6–24% of the riverine ecosystems will be converted into semi lacustrine ecosystems in different rivers. The cascade hydropower development is likely to affect more than 100 fish species. All the EIA reports reviewed have investigated fish species richness, impacts on fish fauna and fishery management plans. EIA studies and management plans, however, do not adequately address important ecological and conservation issues due to various limitations. An integrated fish conservation plan for the upper Teesta basin is suggested in this contribution. {\textcopyright} 2017 IAIA.},

abstract = {River restoration is a widespread phenomenon. This reflects strong public values for conservation, though missing are studies explicitly justifying restoration expenditures. Public restoration benefits are not well quantified, nor are public preferences among diverse activities falling into the broad category ‘‘restoration.'' Our study estimates public values for restoration on the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico. Stakeholder meetings and public focus groups guided development of a restoration survey mailed to Albuquerque area households. Four restoration categories were defined: fish and wildlife; vegetation density; tree type; and natural river processes. Survey responses supplied data for both choice experiment (CE) and contingent valuation (CV) analyses, two established environmental economics techniques for quantifying public benefits of conservation policies. Full restoration benefits are estimated at over $150 per household per year via the CE and at nearly $50 per household per year via CV. The CE allows value disaggregation among different restoration categories. The most highly valued category was tree type, meaning reestablishing native tree dominance for such species as Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and eradicating non-native trees such as Saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissma). The high public values we have found for restoration offer economic justification for intensive riparian management, particularly native plant-based restoration in the Southwest.},

The research on this field is found to be intense, although many challenges are put forward (e.g. choice-task complexity and cognitive effort, experimental design, preference and scale heterogeneity, endogeneity or model uncertainty). Reviewing the state of the art of DCEs serves to draw attention to the main challenges that this methodological approach will need to overcome in the coming years and to identify the frontiers in discrete choice analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Generally newer studies yielded higher WTP. Variables such as the change in the size of the species population, payment frequency, survey mode, response rate, type of respondent, type of species, and a new variable for whether a species is a 'charismatic megafauna' or not, whether the species has use and nonuse value versus nonuse value only and year of the study, were found to significantly influence WTP.

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to estimate the non-market benefits of ecological river restoration and test their transferability across the second largest river basin in Europe. River restoration reduces flood risk and improves water quality, the welfare impacts of which are measured in an identical choice experiment conducted in three Danube river basin countries: Austria, Hungary and Romania. The estimated choice models differ in preference and scale parameters. Distance-decay effects are detected for water quality improvements in Austria and Romania and for a reduction in flood risk in Austria. Public perception of current water quality affects the value people attach to further improvements in water quality levels in all three countries. Controlling for these influencing factors, the estimated non-market benefits of river restoration policy scenarios appear to be transferable between Hungary and Romania, but not between Austria and Hungary and Austria and Romania. Given the role of location specific factors such as differences in population density and degree of urbanization, the use of a generally applicable research design seems a necessary, but insufficient precondition to reduce transfer errors when applying existing estimates of the non-market benefits of river restoration from the international literature to new river restoration contexts.},

The CVM was used to obtain estimates of willingness to pay for restoring Ejina ecosystem services. In our survey, we used a payment card format and a 12-page survey booklet with maps depicting the reasons why Ejina ecosystem deteriorated, the means by which ecosystem services could be restored from their current level. We used an in-person interview along with the survey booklet. We employed a parametric model to estimate the benefits of restoring Ejina ecosystem. Results from 700 in-person interviews indicate that households would pay an average of 19.37 (RMB) per year with 20.78 per household for the main river area, and 16.41 per household for the rest of Hei basin. The aggregate benefit to residents of the Hei basin is 8.84 million annually for 20 years. Taking into account an environmental discount rate calculated by using respondent's equivalent utility between periodical payments and lump sum payments, the present value of aggregate benefit of restoring Ejina ecosystem is 55.33 million. These results suggest that the general public in Hei Valley would be willing to pay to restore the Ejina ecosystem, although this amount is substantially less than the estimated costs of restoration. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Hydroelectric dams have social, cultural, and environmental impacts on society through both alterations of riverine effects (both downstream and in reservoirs) and the production and distribution of hydropower in a broader geographical area. Management of complex dam, hydroelectric, and river systems frequently requires tradeoffs between alternative operational profiles, each with its own set of heterogeneous external effects. Substantial evidence suggests that segments of the public hold non-market values, including non-use values, for both riverine environmental effects and a wide array of external effects of hydropower production and distribution. However, non-market non-use valuation exercises related to re-purposing dam operations continue to focus exclusively on downstream external effects, calling into question their usefulness in decision-making processes. Focusing on the Glen Canyon Dam (GCD), a critical source of hydropower and peaking capacity on the Colorado River, US, we measure non-market values, expected to be significantly composed of non-use values, using the contingent valuation (CV) method for two proposed management options inclusive of multiple social, cultural, and environmental effects of both downstream riverine effects and hydropower production and distribution in the broader basin. To provide a defensible basis for inclusion of relevant external effects in the valuation exercise, we undertook a multi-year study of the GCD policy domain. Using a nationally-representative, address-based CV internet survey, results from an advisory referendum voting format suggest that the average US household has a median net willingness to pay (WTP) to continue existing GCD operations of $21.51 per year [95% CI: $2.98, $40.04] after accounting for WTP to change operations under the US Department of Interior's preferred alternative.

abstract = {This article presents the results of a hedonic property value analysis for multiple hydropower sites along the Kennebec River in Maine, including the former site of the Edwards Dam in Augusta, Maine. The effect of the removal of the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River in Maine is examined through consumer's marginal willingness to pay to be close to or distant from the dam site. Data from both before and after the dam was removed are used to estimate changes in marginal prices. A similar data set is also used to look at the effects of the remaining upstream dams on property values. This article presents one of the first (to our knowledge) ex post analyses on the economic impact of dam removal on property values. As more privately owned dams in the United States come up for relicensing, evaluating the impacts with and without the dam will become increasingly important. This work can help inform those analyses. (JEL Q25, Q51, Q58) {\textcopyright} 2008 Western Economic Association International.},

abstract = {The main objectives of the paper are to (1) give an overview of the state of the art of environmental value transfer, (2) discuss its prospects and potential role in CBA as a decision-support tool, and (3) provide further guidelines for proper use and application. Environmental value or benefit transfer is a technique in which the results of studies on monetary environmental valuation are applied to new policy contexts. The technique is controversial, not least because of academic and political reservations over the usefulness and technical feasibility of economic valuation tools to demonstrate the importance of environmental values in project or programme appraisals. Testing of environmental value transfer so far has been unable to validate the practice. Taking into account the conditions set out in the literature for valid and reliable value transfer, most transfers appear to result in substantial transfer errors. This paper discusses why and addresses the question of which factors may have been overlooked. It is argued that the problem is much more fundamental than previously acknowledged. Strict guidelines in terms of quantitative adjustment mechanisms to valid value transfer are meaningless if the more fundamental issue of differences in the very nature of the values elicited is not addressed at the same time.},

abstract = {Preface: Life without water cannot survive so water is called as the symbol of life. Access to freshwater is a basic human right. Water problems in Bangladesh arise both during the dry season and in the rainy season. Flash floods occur in summer and in the rainy season by sudden release of water at the upstream or by heavy downpour. Again, in the dry season, small rivers dry up because of shortage of water in the big rivers owing to withdrawal of water at the upstream through barrages built and operated by neighbouring country. As a result, irrigation projects in Bangladesh based on river water cease to function, causing losses in crop production and increase in poverty. to follow or abide by ethical principles. This negligence has lingered many of the problems related to sharing international freshwater bodies. This book stands between two concepts of human life, which are interrelated with each other. I envision that this book by virtue of its interdisciplinary character may prove useful in several different kinds of courses: (a) For courses in Social Work that now go under the title of Social Problem Analysis. This book provides a base for studying the economic characteristics of poverty other than the social ones. (b) For course in Methods of Social Research. This book is an introduction of applying modern methods and techniques of scientific and advanced social research. In modern social research, a researcher is concerned with different traditions of knowledge, attitudes, environments and problems. A social worker deals with men and his surroundings. My hope is that it may be a modest contribution to both socio-economic-environmental problem analysis and advanced research methods. Construction of theoretical policy model and use of computer software for simulation purposes must focus new ideas in social work research, which may expand our knowledge in this regard, and I hope students of social sciences in Bangladesh and readers of this book may test some new ideas of using modern social research technologies. It was a challenge for me to publish this research as a book and I carried on helpful conversation with my wife Dr. Wardatul Akmam and former laboratory mate Dr. Mizunoya Takeshi, Dr. Kobayashi Shintarou face-to-face and by e-mail. By this I tried to mitigate the new alerted problems and ideas. However, I am solely responsible for any errors in fact or interpretation which may exist in this book. In a work of this kind, there always remains scope for improvement. Any suggestions of readers are invited and would be accepted gratefully. Although this book is based on a particular research work, I hope it would be helpful for the students and researchers interested in socio-economic and environmental related issues.

These ecosystem services were dilution of wastewater, natural purification of water, erosion control, habitat for fish and wildlife, and recreation. Households were asked a dichotomous choice willingness to pay question regarding purchasing the increase in ecosystem services through a higher water bill. Results from nearly 100 in-person interviews indicate that households would pay an average of $21 per month or $252 annually for the additional ecosystem services. Generalizing this to the households living along the river yields a value of $19 million to $70 million depending on whether those refusing to be interviewed have a zero value or not. Even the lower bound benefit estimates exceed the high estimate of water leasing costs ($1.13 million) and conservation reserve program farmland easements costs ($12.3 million) necessary to produce the increase in ecosystem services.

The goals of the river restoration in terms of ecosystem services are identified, as are the valuation methods used. More than two-thirds of the 38 river restorations reviewed sought to restore and protect fish populations, including in many cases threatened or endangered species. River restorations were also frequently undertaken to improve wildlife habitat, and water quality for boating. In terms of the use of non-market valuations in decision making, six of 38 restorations reviewed involved benefit-cost analyses or environmental assessments or equivalent decision documents. While both revealed preference and stated preference methods were used for valuing river restorations, the majority of restoration valuations (27 out of 38, about 70%) utilized stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). Annual willingness-to-pay per household estimated from the stated preference methods appear logically and positively related to the miles of river restored demonstrating weak scope.},

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a quantitative technique for eliciting preferences that can be used in the absence of revealed preference data. The method involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios, goods or services. Each alternative is described by several attributes and the responses are used to determine whether preferences are significantly influenced by the attributes and also their relative importance. DCEs are widely used in high-income contexts and are increasingly being applied in low- and middle-income countries to consider a range of policy concerns. This paper aims to provide an introduction to DCEs for policy-makers and researchers with little knowledge of the technique. We outline the stages involved in undertaking a DCE, with an emphasis on the design considerations applicable in a low-income setting.},
